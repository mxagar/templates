# Examples of Use of Pytorch for Deep Learning Applications

List of examples (they build up on the previous):

- `pytorch_example_00`: basic but very complete example in which pytorch is introduced; the **whole image classification pipeline** is practiced: model definition, dataset loading and pre-processing, training with validation, and inference. Functions aremodularized and externalized in python scripts.

- `pytorch_example_01`: **transfer learning (DenseNet121) applied to a custom dataset** in which images need to be classified; images are first organized into forlders with a script, and then, the classification pipeline is followed: loading/preprocessing, model transfer, traning, and inference.
