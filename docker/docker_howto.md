## Section 1: Introduction

### 3. What is Docker? Why Docker?

Created in 2013 as open source project, now maintained by Docker Inc.

Paradigm shifts have happened in the past, requiring migrations:
- 90's: shift to PC networks
- 00's: virtualization
- 10's: Cloud
- Now: we are going from hosts to containers

Why docker?
- Like always, it's about speed in all the steps of the lifecycle.
- Containers reduce complexity: we package our code in a container and it runs everywhere
- Applications usually don't need to be changed to be used on docker containers, but they need to be packaged
