# Ordered Data Structures: Week 1 Assignment: Linked Lists and Merge Sort

General instructions:

- Compile: `make clean`, `make` and `make test`
- Run: `./main`, `./test`
- Templated C++ code: code in header files, specific version generated at compilation, depending on how templates are used in code
- File to edit: `LinkedListExercises.h`
- Files to read:
    - `LinkedList.h`: `LinkedList` class
    - `main.cpp`: `main`
    - `tests/week1_test.cpp`: configuration of the `test` program
- For submission: `make zip`

`LinkedList` class:
- Doubly-linked list; can be used as doubled-ended queue/stack: push/pop both ends, constant time access to front/back
- List contains nodes; nodes are created in the heap, each node contains `next` and `prev` pointers and also the data stored.
