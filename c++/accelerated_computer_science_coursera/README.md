# Object Oriented Data Structures in C++

## Week 1: Writing C++ Programs

### 1.1 Introduction

- C++ is strongly typed: each declared variable has type (memory size) + name + value in memory.
- Two types: primitive (int, bool, etc.) and user-defined (classes, containers, etc.).
- A program always needs `int main() { return 0; }`.
    - Return is 0 if OK, non-zero if program fails.
    - `main()` is the starting point
- Makefiles: compile source files into binary coode
    - `_make/generic.mk`: it contains the general makefile used by any local project `Makefile`
    - Command: `make`

### 1.2 C++ Classes

- Encapsulation: Data and Functionality are separated and eclosed into a single unity
- Member variables with `_` at the end: `length_`
- Member functions with camelCase: `getLength()`
- Layers of protection:
    - public: anyone can access it
    - private: only members
- Encapsulation is also achieved with header files and source code files
    - Header: API: `*.h`
    - Source: The implementation goes here: `*cpp`
- Header files: declaration must be only once!
    - Add: `#pragma once`

`cpp-class/Cube.h`: the API
```c++
#pragma once // compile this declaration/file once
class Cube {
    public:
        double getLength();
        double getVolume();
        void setLength(double length);
    private:
        double length_;
}; // always end declarations with ;
```

`cpp-class/Cube.cpp`: the implementation
```c++
#include "Cube.h"
double Cube::getLength() {
    return length_;
}
double Cube::getVolume() {
    return (length_ * length_ * length_);
}
void Cube::setLength(double length) {
    length_ = length
}
```

`cpp-class/main.cpp`: the application
```c++
#include "Cube.h"
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    Cube c;
    c.setLength(3.14);
    std::cout << "Cube volume = " << c.getVolume() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### 1.3 C++ Standard Library: STD / STL

- Standard library interfaced by several headers which must be included
- We need to put namespace: `std::cout << ...`
    - Alternatively: `using std::cout;` -> `cout`
    - Or: `using namespace std;`; but that is dangerous...
- Typical interfaces:

```c++
#include <iostream> // console out: std::cout, end line: std::endl
```

- Classes or actually anything can be wrapped in a `namespace` to avoid conflicts due to same names and make clear where each class belongs to

```c++
namespace mkl {
    // Declaration
    class Cube {
        public:
            void setLength(double length);
    };
} // no ;

...

namespace mkl {
    // Implementation
    void Cube::setLength(double length) {
        length_ = length;
    }
}

...

mkl::Cube c;
```
