# Object Oriented Data Structures in C++

## Week 1: Writing C++ Programs

### Introduction

- C++ is strongly typed: each declared variable has type (memory size) + name + value in memory.
- Two types: primitive (int, bool, etc.) and user-defined (classes, containers, etc.).
- A program always needs `int main() { return 0; }`.
    - Return is 0 if OK, non-zero if program fails.
    - `main()` is the starting point
