    "**MeanShift** Algorithm: clustering algorithm similar to k-means, that finds local maxima of any number of clusters present in the feature space. Main steps of the algorithm:\n",
    "- for each data point/sample, we open a window and compute a weighted mean of all the samples within it\n",
    "- we move the point to the computed mean, and we repeat\n",
    "- eventually, all points will converge to cluster centroids!\n",
    "\n",
    "While with k-means thenumber of clusters is selected, with mean-shift the number of clusters is computed automatically -- that might result in a non-intuitive number clusters, too...\n",
    "\n",
    "How to apply it to tracking? We select a target area and compute its hue color histogram; then, we keep sliding the tracking window to the closest match (the cluster center): the movement is basically the shift of the window of the previous iteration on the new/current frame in the direction where the centroid of the intensities of the window is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CamShift** = Continuously Adaptive (window) Mean Shift. It is a mean-shift where the window changes its size according to the object size, which can actually vary if we move away or towards the camera. The size is updated after converging: we basically update the window size and its ellipsoid orientation."
