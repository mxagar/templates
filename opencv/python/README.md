# OpenCV Templates in Python

This folder contains OpenCV templates in python.
The Jupyter notebooks were created after following the Udemy course [Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) by Jos√© Portilla.

The original course notebooks are in `course/`.

These are informal tests while following the course (informal, because I had already experience with the functionalities tested in them, so the code is non exhaustive, rather smaller tests):
- `02_Numpy_Basics.ipynb`
- `03_Images_with_OpenCV.ipynb`
- `04_Image_Processing.ipynb`

The following notebooks contain more formally formated material:
- `05_Video_Basics.ipynb`
- ...

The `.py` scripts contain snippets for most common OpenCV functions.
