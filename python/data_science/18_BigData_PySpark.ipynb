    "Datasets that are smaller than 8 Gb can be processed **locally**, but when the data exceeds that limit, we need to start using **distributed systems**. On distributed systems, one machine (main node) controls how to distribute the data aross several machines (worker nodes); thus, we **scale** the processing power and become **fault-tolerant**: if a node/machine fails, the model/system still works distributed on the rest.\n",

    "### Hadoop: HDFS & MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache **Hadoop** is often used in such distrubuted systems. Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities for computer networks that process massive amounts of data.\n",
    "- Hadoop uses **HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File system**; these allow distributuÃ­ng large datasets across several machines\n",
    "- As HDFS is used to distrubute data, **MapReduce** is used to distribute computation on HDFS data\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on HDFS & MapReduce:\n",
    "- HDFS distributes the data in blocks (of 128 MB by default) for parallelization, and replicates each block 3x; blocks are distributed for fault-tolerance\n",
    "- MapReduce distributes a computation task to a distributed set of files\n",
    "    - It has one **job tracker** (in the main node) and **task trackers** on the distributed nodes\n",
    "    - Job trackers send code to run to the task trackers\n",
    "    - Task trackers allocate CPU + RAM and monitor the tasks on the worker nodes\n",
    "    \n",
    "An alternative to MapReduce is **Spark**, a technology gaining popularity for Big Data.\n"

    "### Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is an open source general pupose cluster computing framework, like an alternative for MapReduce, but which can be still used with Hadoop. It supports data stored in many formats:\n",
    "- Cassandra\n",
    "- AWS S3\n",
    "- HDFS\n",
    "- and more\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is 100x faster than MapReduce because it keeps the data in the RAM, whereas MapReduce writes the data to disk after eahc transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark works with **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**.\n",
    "The conceptual functioning is as explained for Hadoop: we have a cluster manager node which controls worker nodes; all nodes are additionally interfaced by a driver program with a SparkContext.\n",
    "However, the users interact usually with RDD obejcts.\n",
    "RDDs have 4 main features:\n",
    "- Distributed Collection of Data\n",
    "- Fault-tolerant\n",
    "- Parallel operations\n",
    "- Ability to use many data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs perform basically two types of operations:\n",
    "- Transformations; common examples:\n",
    "    - RDD.filter(): apply a function to each element and return elements that evaluate to true\n",
    "    - RDD.map(): transform elements with a function and return same number of elements; like pd.apply()\n",
    "        - Example: grab first letter from a list of names\n",
    "    - RDD.flatMap(): transform each element (e.g., a tuple/array) into N elements; number of total elements is changed\n",
    "        - Example: transform a corpus of text into a list of words\n",
    "- Actions; common examples:\n",
    "    - Collect: return all the elements of the RDD as an array\n",
    "    - Count: Return number of elements in the RDD\n",
    "    - First: Return first element in the RDD\n",
    "    - Take: Return an array with the first n elements in the RDD\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also Pair RDDs, which contain key-value pairs; these have additionally these operations, which are similar to pd.groupby():\n",
    "- Reduce: aggregate RDD elements and return a single element\n",
    "- ReduceByKey\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark ecosystem is expanding very fast; now, there are: Spark SQL, Spark DataFrames, MLlib, Spark Streaming, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: We can use Spark on our local machine to learn (pnly on Ubuntu), but it only makes sense to use it on a cloud service, like AWS. If we plan to work locally, it makes more sense to work with pandas or SQL.**\n"
